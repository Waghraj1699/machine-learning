## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is a process of preparing the raw data and making it suitable for a machine learning model.

A real-world data generally contains noises, missing values, and maybe in an unusable format which cannot be 
directly used for machine learning models.

It involves following steps:

1.Importing the Libraries
2.Importing the dataset
     - Extracting dependent and independent
3.Handling Missing Data
4.Encoding Categorical Data
5.Splittin Data into Test set and Training set
6.Feature Scaling
