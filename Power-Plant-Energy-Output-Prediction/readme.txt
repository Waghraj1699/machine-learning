#This is model selection project for Regression Model 

Used kaggel to perform all the Regression models.

1.Multiple linear regression
2.Polynomial regression
3.Support vector regression
4.Decision tress regression
5.Random forest regression

Based on parameters like ambient temperture,exhaust Vacuum,ambient pressure,realtive humidity we are predicting
the electrical energy output of the plant.

out of this Random forest Regression performs the best with accuracy over 90 % .
