# Decision Tree Classification

Decision Tree is a Supervised learning technique that can be used for both classification and Regression.

In a Decision tree, there are two nodes, which are the Decision Node and Leaf Node. Decision nodes are used 
to make any decision and have multiple branches,whereas Leaf nodes are the output of those decisions and do 
not contain any further branches.
