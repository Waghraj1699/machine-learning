#projet : Breast cancer Detection an classification

Based on the the various parameter we predict the whether a person has a breast cancer on not. using the following algorithms

1.Logistic Regression (act as classification)
2.Support Vector classification
3.Kernel support vector classification
4.Naive Baye's classification
5.K-nearest Neighbor's Classification
6.Decision Tree Classification
7.Random forest Classification

Out of this Kernel support vector classification performs the best with success rate over 95 %.
